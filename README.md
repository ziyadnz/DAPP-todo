# Flutter Solidity Todo List DAPP

This project includes the Todo List application, an Ethereum DAPP developed using the Flutter language. A contract was written with solidty to be included in the DAPP ecosystem. This DAPP allows a user to manage their to-do list. The user can add new tasks on the list, complete existing tasks, or remove tasks from the list.

## Features

- User-friendly interface: Users can easily add, complete and remove their tasks.
- Integration with Ethereum: The DAPP interacts with the Ethereum blockchain and stores users' tasks on the blockchain.
- Solidity smart contract: Solidity smart contract running behind the DAPP allows users to securely store and process tasks.
